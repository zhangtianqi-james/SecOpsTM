# Elevating Cyber Resilience with Automated Threat Modeling

Welcome to the official documentation for **SecOpsTM** — a STRIDE threat modeling framework
with MITRE ATT&CK mapping, AI-enhanced threat generation, and interactive diagram export.

In an era of escalating cyber threats and rapid development cycles, traditional security practices
often fall short. SecOpsTM bridges that gap by embodying **Threat Modeling as Code (TMasC)**:
threat models are human-readable, version-controlled Markdown files that integrate naturally into
CI/CD pipelines and cross-functional workflows.

## Why Automated Threat Modeling?

- **Proactive risk identification** — shift left by catching design flaws early in the SDLC
- **Scalable security** — automate threat analysis across distributed systems and microservices
- **Actionable intelligence** — translate abstract threats into MITRE ATT&CK-mapped techniques
- **DevSecOps enablement** — version-controlled, machine-readable models shared across Dev, Sec, and Ops
- **Continuous assurance** — integrate threat analysis directly into CI/CD pipelines

## Core Capabilities

- **STRIDE threat identification** — automatic coverage across all six STRIDE categories for every component and dataflow
- **Rich enrichment** — each threat mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics/techniques, CAPEC attack patterns, and D3FEND countermeasures
- **AI-enhanced generation** — LLM + RAG pipeline surfaces threats beyond rule-based analysis
- **Context-aware severity** — scoring adjusts for encryption, authentication, network exposure, CVE signals, and D3FEND mitigations
- **Hierarchical modeling** — decompose large systems into linked sub-models with drill-down diagrams
- **Comprehensive exports** — HTML reports, STIX 2.1, ATT&CK Navigator layers, SVG diagrams, ZIP bundles
- **IaC integration** — generate threat models directly from Ansible and Terraform configurations
